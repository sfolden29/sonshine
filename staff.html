                    <p class = "leftstaff">This is a person who is responsible for creating an atmosphere for ministry on the boats.  Team Barnabas members quickly pick up the nick name “Barney”.  It is the “Barney's” job to facilitate meal preparation and maintain a clean boat.  The Barney is also there to help the driver park the boats and get campers ready to ski.  The Barney spends most of the time on the houseboat with campers engaged in one-on-one and group conversations that have an impact on the campers.  Additional “jobs” for the Barney vary from group to group as some may need help with small groups, worship, or share your testimony.  Barneys volunteer for 3 weeks of the summer.</p>

                    <p class = "centerstaff">This position is for those who have the desire to be boat drivers.  To be a Trainee you must have been either a Team Barnabas member or be at least one year out of high school.  The Trainee position is a mixture between the Barnabas and Driver position. Trainee's will learn to drive the houseboat and ski boats while getting to know campers and helping the youth group in any way needed.  During the 5-week volunteer program the Trainee will rotate from boat to boat to learn from different drivers.  It is essential that Trainee's are patient, flexible, teachable people who love students and love serving Jesus Christ.</p>

                    <p class="rightstaff"> Officially titled Program Coordinator – This person does a combination of the two other titles.  The Driver works the entire summer, usually about 10 weeks, driving the houseboat they live on as well as a ski boat shared with another Driver.  They teach campers to ski, wakeboard, kneeboard and banana. The Driver is ultimately responsible for the safety of everyone on both boats and directly communicates with the youth pastor to make sure the program is running smoothly.  Drivers meet daily with their Trainee and Barney to pray for their boat and discuss how the week is going.  Drivers complete a week of training before campers arrive.  </p>
