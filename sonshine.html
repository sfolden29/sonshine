            <p class = "text">We are a camp completely on water.  Put 13 students, 2 leaders from your group, and 2 Sonshine staff on a houseboat with skiing, wakeboarding, banana boating, swimming, and floaties galore; add Bible study, worship, sharing and you come up with one of the best weeks of your life!  Sonshine staff work with your leadership to custom tailor the most incredible week on your ministry calendar. The combination of your leadership, our equipment and staff, along with the incredible power of Godâ€™s Spirit makes it happen year after year. Sonshine Ministries is so much more than just a summer camp.  Sonshine Ministries is the leading organization and experience in discipleship and leadership for Jesus Christ.  Let us share our ministry with you.  Focus on evangelism, discipleship, leadership development, or just a fun time in the sun with your students, whatever the trip purpose Sonshine Ministries can accommodate and enhance your efforts and goals.  The reason why Sonshine Ministries is so unique is that we do not dictate your group's spiritual emphasis.  Sonshine provides all the equipment and logistics while the church brings the spiritual guidance; however our staff are always standing by ready to assist or lead your group in worship, small groups, or give a message if need be.  We will do as little or as much as you need.  Small group or large, when you partner with Sonshine Ministries our experience, knowledge base, and camping model will bring you greater congruency, focus, and clarity to the personal and professional roles to which God has called you.
