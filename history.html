                    The camp was founded by two Azusa Pacific University graduates <u><a  class = "linkcol"href="https://homeword.com/about/jim-burns/" target = "_blank">Jim Burns</a> </u>and <a class = "linkcol"href="http://www.crossroadscov.com/staff" target = "_blank"><u>Russ Blake.</u></a>  Jim and Russ both had a passion for youth and a vision for youth ministry in a small group recreational setting.  With ties to northern California, a road trip north landed them on the levies of the Sacramento River Delta.  The two decided that a houseboat would be the perfect venue for this new ministry adventure God had been revealing in their hearts.  After a financial sacrifice from Jim, the first Sonshine Ministries houseboat was purchased, a 42 foot "Boatel". The camp operated out of Bethel Island for the first few summers.

                        This year brought about the camp's first ski boat purchase...."The Witchcraft".  Enough said!

                      The summer of 1978 the camp found its new home at Walnut Grove Marina.  The marina decided to build two "specialty" houseboats constructed perfectly to meet the needs and demands of the camp.  Upon their maiden voyage one of these "specialty" houseboats sank! In 1979 the camp moved again this time to Turner Cut. 1978/79 Sonshine Ministries changed its name to Pacific Coast Study Center.  Jim's dream was to train youth leaders and host conferences.  Camp finances and resources were leveraged to attain this new vision.

                      1981 brought another "new" home for the camp, King Island Marina.  King Island offered the camp the ability to grow through renting houseboats.  The camp expanded to 6 houseboats a week for 6-8 weeks a summer.  This was the "norm" for the next 3 years. By mid summer 1981 the camp had run out of money.  A board of directors member loaned the camp the money needed to make it through the summer.  Following the 1981 summer Jim and Russ decided to step aside from running the day to day ministry and name Brad Vanderhamm the new Executive Director.  Brad had been directing the camp since 1978.  Jim moved on to new ministry adventures while Russ remained on the Board of Directors for a few more summers before moving on to become a youth pastor at a church. The camp once again underwent a name change.  Sonshine Specialized Camping Ministries was the new name by the summer of 1982. Another move!  Imagine youth pastors telling parents that they are taking their kids to "Whisky Slough" for a Christian houseboat retreat.  For two summers Whisky Slough Marina was home to the fleet.  One notable Whisky Slough moment was a marina fire that resulted in burning an entire side of one of Sonshine's houseboats.

                      The final move in 1986 brought the camp to Paradise Point Marina where the Delta camp still is today.  This move also brought about the relationship with Seven Crowns Resorts our houseboat provider.  The summer of 1990 birthed the satellite camp on Lake Shasta.  Bridge Bay Marina was home to Sonshine Specialized Camping Ministries on Lake Shasta.  In 1991 Sonshine entered into a relationship with Larson Marine a local boat dealership.  This unique relationship allowed Sonshine to grow while keeping camper prices low.  In 1993 the growth continued with the expansion of the camp to Lake Mojave.  Katherine Landings Marina was home to Sonshine Specialized Camping Ministries on Lake Mojave.  In 1996 the Shasta camp moved to Digger Bay Marina and operated there until 2008.  By 1997 the cost to operate our Mojave camp became too much and clients were redirected to our Shasta Camp.  The summer of 1997 was our last on Lake Mojave.
